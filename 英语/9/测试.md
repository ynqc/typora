##### Dear teacher, I have been learning English First for two months, and I have taken 8 online courses， and study units 7, 8 and 9. 

##### So far there has been some progress。 I want to go to the next level of learning, so I come to the English test. I hope you can pass it and continue to study

I am a little busy at present. I just participated in the hackthon project competition organized by the company, and I hope to have a good time to relax. Maybe take two days off to rest 

Now it is autumn, and I plan to visit Xiangshan with my husband



In class, the teacher will teach me pronunciation and correct my pronunciation, but it is a long-term learning process, which requires constant learning and opening the mouth to speak

Maybe progress is slow, but I want to study higher level courses

The English class is a training course for the company, and only if you pass the test, you will be reimbursed
